# Welcome to My Printf
***

## Task
The project was to create a minimalist version of the printf() function in C.

## Description
I created several small functions to handle each requested case. And a my_printf function to manage all of this.

## Installation
I used a C file where all my functions are grouped together, as well as a Makefile file for compiling.

## Usage
I created several small functions so that each one handles a specific case. A dispatcher() function allows me to send to one of these functions by determining which letter is behind the %; if it is not a letter 
specific to a format, it is displayed normally. And finally, I created my function my_printf(), which is the main function that will go through the character string we are given, display it character by character,
and call the dispatcher() function if it finds a %.
